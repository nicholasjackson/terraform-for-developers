# Installing providers

To download and install the providers needed for this example run the following command.

```hcl
terraform init
```

# Creating resources

You can then run the command `terraform apply` to create the resources, all resources should use the free tiers of DigitalOcean and Cloudflare.

```shell
âžœ terraform apply

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with
the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # digitalocean_app.static_site_example will be created
  + resource "digitalocean_app" "static_site_example" {
      + active_deployment_id = (known after apply)
      + created_at           = (known after apply)
      + default_ingress      = (known after apply)
      + id                   = (known after apply)

            }

          + static_site {
              + name       = "hcl"
              + source_dir = "/src"

              + github {
                  + branch         = "main"

                  + repo           = "nicholasjackson/mame-wasm"
                }

                }
            }
        }
    }
